    <h3> Greta Van Fleet is 4 young musicians - twin brothers Josh (vocals) and Jake Kiszka (guitar), both 22, younger brother Sam (bass/keys, 19), 
        and longtime friend Danny Wagner (drums, 20). All from the tiny Michigan hamlet of Frankenmuth known for its chicken dinners and the world’s largest Christmas store. All were raised 
        on their parents’ vinyl collections which
         helped give birth to the music they make today: a high-energy hybrid of rock’n’roll, blues and soul.</h3>
