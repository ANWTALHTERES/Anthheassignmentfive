 <h2> Donald Glover, in full Donald McKinley Glover, Jr., also known as Childish Gambino, (born September 25, 1983, Edwards Air Force Base, California, U.S.), 
     American writer, comedian, actor, and musician who won acclaim in all his disparate arts. He was perhaps best known for
      the TV series Atlanta (2016–18) and for the music he released under the name Childish Gambino.</h2>
     
      <h3> Glover grew up in Stone Mountain, Georgia, where his father was a postal worker and his mother a 
          day-care manager. He had two siblings, and his parents served as foster parents throughout his childhood. After graduating 
          (2002) from DeKalb School of the Arts, he attended New York University’s Tisch School of the Arts (B.A., 2006). As a student, Glover was a founding 
          member of the sketch comedy group Derrick Comedy, and he also embarked on a rap career. In 2006 he was hired as a writer for Tina Fey’s new sitcom 30 Rock, and he stayed with the show for 
          three seasons, occasionally appearing onscreen as well. </h3>
