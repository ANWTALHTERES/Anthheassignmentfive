 <h2> The Weeknd, byname of Abel Makkonen Tesfaye, (born February 16, 1990, Toronto, Ontario, Canada), Canadian rhythm-and-bluessinger and 
     songwriter who was perhaps best known for his explicit songs about sex and drugs, many of which were autobiographical, and for his soaring falsetto and its singular tremolo.
    With Drake as an admirer and backer, Tesfaye had greater access to recording opportunities, and by March 2011 he had put together a nine-song mixtape, House of Balloons, which 
    he released as a free download. The album gained critical notice and was short-listed for Canadaâ€™s Polaris Music Prize. Tesfaye made his first public appearance 
    as The Weeknd in a Toronto nightclub in July that year.</h2>
