 <h2> Frank Ocean was born in Long Beach, California, on October 28, 1987. He grew up in New Orleans, but moved to Los Angeles in his
      late teens to pursue a career in music. Ocean started out ghostwriting tracks for such pop stars as Justin Bieber and Beyoncé, but soon achieved
       fame as an artist when, in 2011, he released a mixtape of his own music, titled nostalgia, ULTRA.
    He released the recordings as a free download on his Tumblr site, without Def Jam’s knowledge, announcing via Twitter that he had done so because the label had
     not been supportive of his efforts after signing him. Ocean’s self-released recording featured a mixture of both originally composed music and heavy samples of tracks 
     from the likes of Coldplay, the Eagles and MGMT. The album was widely acclaimed, and received enthusiastic reviews from NPR, Rolling Stone and the BBC, among many others. Also 
     impressed with his efforts were superstars Jay-Z and Kanye West, who, at Beyoncé’s 
    prompting, enlisted Ocean to contribute vocals for two tracks from their August 2011 album, Watch the Throne.</h2>
