 <h2> The young four-member band met while they were still in high school, and it was in their town of Salt Lake City, Utah where some of their early songs first gained popularity. 
     But four years after their high school graduation, they came to D.C. with almost 4.3 million monthly listeners on Spotify and 
     “Kilby Girl,” their TikTok viralsong that’s racked up more than 115 million listens alone.</h2>

<h3>The Backseat Lovers came on close to 9:30 p.m. and kicked off their set with a three-and-a-half minute lyric-less jam session showcasing the clean and powerful 
    electric guitar that defines that band’s sound. The crowd started to head bang and dance almost immediately and 
    screamed with excitement when this wordless jam led effortlessly into their first song “Pool House.” </h3>
